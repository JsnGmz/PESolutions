# Solutions to problems from Project Euler 

Each .js file contains a problem and a solution from Project Euler. Solutions have comments in them explaining the solution. Because the solutions are written in javascript you can copy and paste them onto a browser console in order to test them yourself (cmd + opt + k/j for Firefox/Chrome respectively).
I personally used node to run all the files to check to make sure it worked.

A few things to note.
1. These are not the only ways to solve the problems simply the way I choose to solve them. 
2. *If you have not tried the problems yourself you should not look at any of the .js files.*
3. Some solutions may use a library. To get them to work you will need to run `yarn install`.
